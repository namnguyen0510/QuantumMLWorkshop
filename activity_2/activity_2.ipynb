More specifically, it is a pair $(X,d)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a distance function $d$ that assigns a non-negative real number to any pair of points in $X$ and satisfies the following axioms:\n",
    "- Non-negativity: $d(x,y)\\geq 0$ for all $x,y\\in X$, and $d(x,y)=0$ if and only if $x=y$.\n",
    "- Symmetry: $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$ for all $x,y\\in X$.\n",
    "- Triangle inequality: $d(x,z)\\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$ for all $x,y,z\\in X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of $X$ are called the points of the metric space, and the distance function $d$ is often called the metric. Intuitively, the metric measures the \"distance\" between any two points in the set $X$.\n",

    "To this point, we can see that \\textit{metric spaces are a special class of topological spaces} that satisfy certain additional properties. Specifically, every metric space is a topological space, where the topology is induced by the metric. The open sets in the metric topology are defined to be the sets that contain an open ball around each point. Besides, every metric space is Hausdorff, since the triangle inequality implies that any two distinct points in a metric space can be separated by disjoint open balls. Nevertheless, not all topological spaces are metric spaces or Hausdorff spaces. For example, the topological space consisting of a single point with the trivial topology (i.e., the only open sets are the empty set and the entire space) is not Hausdorff, and there is no metric that induces the given topology.\n",

    "Given two topological spaces $(X,\\mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y,\\mathcal{T}_Y)$, their Cartesian product $X\\times Y$ is defined as the set of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x\\in X$ and $y\\in Y$. We can define a topology on $X\\times Y$ by defining a \\textbf{basis of open sets}. Specifically, we can take the collection of all sets of the form $U\\times V$, where $U\\in\\mathcal{T}_X$ and $V\\in\\mathcal{T}_Y$, as a basis for the product topology on $X\\times Y$. The product topology is the topology generated by this basis, meaning that it consists of all unions of finite intersections of sets in the basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The product topology is the natural topology to put on the Cartesian product of two topological spaces, since it makes the projection maps $\\pi_X:X\\times Y\\to X$ and $\\pi_Y:X\\times Y\\to Y$ continuous, where $\\pi_X((x,y))=x$ and $\\pi_Y((x,y))=y$. Intuitively, the product topology is the \"weakest\" topology that makes the projection maps continuous. In particular, suppose that $\\mathcal{T}$ is a topology on $X\\times Y$ that makes both projection maps continuous. Then, for any open set $U$ in $X$ and any open set $V$ in $Y$, the sets $\\pi_X^{-1}(U)$ and $\\pi_Y^{-1}(V)$ are open in the product topology, since they are of the form $U\\times Y$ and $X\\times V$, respectively. Therefore, by the continuity of the projection maps, their intersection $\\pi_X^{-1}(U) \\cap \\pi_Y^{-1}(V)$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}$. Since any basis element of the product topology can be expressed as a union of sets of the form $U\\times V$, it follows that the topology $\\mathcal{T}$ contains all basis elements of the product topology. Therefore, the product topology is the smallest topology on $X\\times Y$ that makes both projection maps continuous, and hence it is the weakest topology that makes the projection maps continuous.\n",

    "A topological space $X$ is said to be \\textbf{compact} if every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover. In other words, if ${U_i}{i\\in I}$ is a collection of open subsets of $X$ such that $X=\\bigcup{i\\in I}U_i$, then there exists a finite subset $J\\subseteq I$ such that $X=\\bigcup_{j\\in J}U_j$. Intuitively, a compact space is a space that is \"small enough\" to be covered by finitely many open sets. Examples of compact spaces include any finite topological space (since every cover of a finite set must have a finite subcover), the closed unit interval $[0,1]$, and the unit sphere $S^n$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n",

    "A topological space $X$ is said to be \\textbf{connected} if it cannot be expressed as the union of two nonempty disjoint open subsets. In other words, if $U$ and $V$ are nonempty disjoint open subsets of $X$ such that $X = U \\cup V$, then either $U$ or $V$ (or both) must be empty. Intuitively, a connected space is a space that cannot be \"split into pieces\" that are separated from each other.

    "An analytic manifold is a mathematical object that describes a shape or space that looks smooth and curved such as a sphere or a donut. The term \"analytic\" is from a special kind of math called \"analytic functions.\" These functions can be written as an infinite sum of terms that get smaller and smaller as we go further out, like zooming in on a fractal picture. To understand an analytic manifold, imagine we can look at a sphere. If we zoom in extremely close, the surface will look flat like a piece of paper. But as we zoom out, the surface is actually curved. An analytic manifold is like a sphere, but it can have any arbitrarily number of dimensions, not just three like a regular sphere. Noted that not all manifolds are analytic. For example, a ice cube is a manifold, but it has sharp corners and edges, which means it's not smooth and curved as an analytic manifold.\n",

    "Formally, an $n$-dimensional analytic manifold is a \\textbf{second-countable Hausdorff} space $M$ together with an \\textbf{atlas} (\\textbf{homeomorphic}) ${(U_i,\\phi_i)}$ such that the transition maps $\\phi_i \\circ \\phi_j^{-1} : \\phi_j(U_i \\cap U_j) \\rightarrow \\phi_i(U_i \\cap U_j)$ are analytic functions. An analytic function is a function that can be locally represented by a convergent power series. This means that an analytic manifold is a manifold that locally looks like Euclidean space, and whose global structure can be understood using analytic functions. A topological space is said to be second-countable if it has a countable basis or a collection of countable open sets that can be used to generate all of the other open sets in the space.\n",

In other words, $f$ is an isomorphism in the category of topological spaces. Formally, a homeomorphism is defined as follows: Let $f:X \\rightarrow Y$ be a bijection. Then $f$ is a homeomorphism if and only if for any subset $U \\subseteq X$, $f(U)$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $U$ is open in $X$.\n",

    "We find that Lie Group is a prominent tool for studying structural biology. First, the DNA topology can be considered as a Lie Group, which is used to describe the global structure of DNA molecules. Second, the group of local DNA conformations is also a Lie group and is used to describe the local geometry of DNA molecules. This group is important for understanding how DNA molecules interact with other molecules and how the local geometry of DNA affects its function. Finally, the study of DNA knots and links is also closely related to Lie Groups. Knot theory is used to understand how DNA molecules can form knots and links, which is important for understanding how DNA molecules interact with each other and with other molecules in the cell.\n",
